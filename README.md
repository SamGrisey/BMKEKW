# BMKEKW

Idk man i cant think of a better name. 

Car buying sites make comparing vehicles by options a pain in the ass. Not all dealerships will post all options in their listings, sometimes the same option will appear under different names, and some aggregators dont even have an options filter.

For discerning BMW enthusiasts or BMW buyers trying to make sense of the gorillion options the manufacturer offers, BMKEKW is here to be of marginal assistance.

This is a filtering utility for narrowing down BMW vehicles by installed options provided through [bimmer.work](https://www.bimmer.work).

Includes both manual and automated vehicle import methods enabled through the selenium webdriver.
